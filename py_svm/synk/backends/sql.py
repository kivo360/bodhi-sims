These queries are used to create the tables and insert data into the database for the accounting system within for the duckdb arrow interface.

The primary reason for using SQL commands is to make it easier to port to other databases within the future. 
In all likelihood this will be the grounds for a large-scale agent-based modelling framework, a large-scale financial modelling framework, then (likely) a full-blown operations framework.

SQL commands can be transferred quickly.
